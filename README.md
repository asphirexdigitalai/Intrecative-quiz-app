Interactive Quiz Web Application

Introduction

This project is a simple yet engaging Interactive Quiz Web Application designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents users with multiple-choice questions, records their answers, and provides a final score at the end. The quiz dynamically updates as users progress, making it an engaging learning tool.

Features

This interactive quiz application includes the following features:

1. Multiple-choice questions – Users can choose from four possible answers for each question.


2. Dynamic question loading – Questions are stored in a JavaScript array and rendered dynamically.


3. Score tracking – Correct answers are recorded, and a final score is displayed at the end.


4. Responsive design – The interface adjusts for different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.


5. Interactive UI – A visually appealing gradient background and intuitive layout enhance user experience.


6. Restart functionality – Users can play the quiz again after completing it.



Technologies Used

This project utilizes fundamental web technologies:

HTML – Defines the structure of the quiz, including question containers and answer options.

CSS – Styles the quiz with a modern, gradient-based UI, shadow effects, and smooth transitions.

JavaScript – Handles quiz logic, including question selection, answer validation, and score calculation.


How It Works

1. Displaying Questions

The quiz loads questions from an array stored in JavaScript. The script dynamically updates the displayed question and answer choices.

2. Handling User Input

Users select an answer using radio buttons. When they click Submit, JavaScript checks whether the answer is correct.

3. Score Calculation

Each correct answer increments the score counter. After the last question, the final score is displayed along with a "Play Again" button.

4. Restarting the Quiz

The quiz resets when users click "Play Again," allowing them to retake the quiz with a fresh start.
